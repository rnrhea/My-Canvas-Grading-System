# My-Canvas-Grading-System
by Rhea Nair

For this project, I created a basic ‘Canvas’ classroom page for
the professor’s view. The professor will be able to see a list of the students in their
course. Some functions include being able to add student to the course, update a
student’s grade, and remove a student from the course. A professor will also be able to
create announcements.
